# F(R)EE

An application that allows you to see how much you have spent on fees while using the Solana blockchain. 

V2: Detailed wallet analytics coming soon tm

## Aims :dart:

The purpose of this application is simple. To show the user how much they have spent on fees while using the Solana blockchain and to show savings versus using ETH mainnet. 

Q: Hey... this application sucks! 
A: Yeah, as of right now it probably does. But several feature upgrades are planned, including wallet analytics & mint fees as an NFT. What else does the future hold? Who knows! 

Q: I have a feature request!
A: Open an issue detailing the request, and I'll see what I can do about it

Q: Why did you build this? 
A: IDK feeling cute for H Y P E R D R I V E

Q: Does this project have a Discord? 
A: No, never

## Contributions :wave:

Contributions of any form are encouraged and appreciated. Please follow the "fork and pull" Git workflow if you would like to create a new feature: 

1. Fork the repo on Github
2. Clone the repo onto your own machine
3. Create a new branch and commit any changes to this branch
4. Push your work to back up your fork
5. Submit a pull request and request review from jhuhnke

IMPORTANT: Be sure to merge the lastest commit from upstream before submitting a pull request.

The more detailed the branch name and description of the pull request, the better! A thorough description of what you are adding to the codebase will help speed up the review process. 

To report a bug or submit a feature request, please use the issues tab to open and submit an issue. The more detailed the bug report or feature request, the easier it is for me to integrate it into the application!

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
